I thought this could be of interest to the ones trying to fix problems with their Z-680, for instance, extending cables or repairing a defective unit.
My Z-680 was down 2 times, re-imbursed once by the e-shop I bought it on, the second has been replaced by a Z-5500 from Logitech. Hopefully... In this case, they ask you to cut cables and send them the cables. Before doing so, I checked the cabling of the SUB-D used to connect the control pod to the subwoofer.
I hate throwing things away, I prefer to repair them. So I solded a new Sub-D before fixing the power supply that was the cause of the problem. Here is what I have:
- the control pod cable contains 2 sets of wires: first set contains the signals, shielded. The second set seems to contain power wires.
- Sub-D are normalized, they are made of 15 pins in 3 rows. Check the digits used on the plug, that what I use here
- The SUb-D is female
- 1: black and brown wire (signal)
- 2: grey and black wire (signal)
- 3: Grey wire (signal)
- 4: purple wire (signal)
- 5: brown (signal)
- 6: shield
- 7: yellow
- 8: nothing
- 9: purple and black (signal)
- 10: red
- 11: red and black
- 12: green
- 13: nothing
- 14: white
- 15: blue

Hope this is understandable, forgive my approximate English, I am not good for technical terms.
